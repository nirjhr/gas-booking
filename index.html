        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <p>
          Anila Gas Company is an Indian company supplying LPG cooking gas for
          consumers all over India. It supplies the gas through distributors.
          The company has offices in each state which manage all the area
          offices under it. The area offices manage all distributors in that
          district. The company has various types of gas cylinders like 5kg,
          14.5kg, etc.
        </p>

        <h2>Our Operations</h2>
        <p>
          Each state office maintains the details about area offices such as
          unique area number, name, address, manager. State offices have unique
          names, addresses, and store the total number of area offices, total
          distributors under each area office, and total sales in each area. The
          area offices have unique area numbers, names, and total sales, and
          also maintain distributor details such as unique distributor number,
          name, address, and proprietor. They also store total sales in that
          area and sales by each distributor.
        </p>

        <h2>Consumer Services</h2>
        <p>
          The distributor maintains the details about all the consumers such as
          unique consumer number, name, address, pin code, contact number, email
          ID, distributor, number of cylinders, and date of connection. To get a
          new connection, the consumer should provide their details and submit
          documents for address proof. On payment of the requisite deposit, the
          consumer will be issued a Subscription Voucher (SV). The SV contains
          consumer number, consumer name, address, date of connection,
          distributor name, deposit amount, type of cylinder, number of
          cylinders, and distributor name and address.
        </p>

        <h2>Booking and Delivery</h2>
        <p>
          The consumer can book gas by calling or personally visiting by
          providing their consumer number. They will be informed about the
          booking number and the date they will receive the gas. The receiving
          date of gas will be 5 days after the booking date. The distributor
          office maintains the stock registry of gas which includes details of
          cylinder type, price, and quantity. It is updated after supplying gas
          to the consumer. The area officer transfers cylinders from one
          distributor to another based on demand.
        </p>

        <h2>Connection Transfer</h2>
        <p>
          The consumer can transfer their connection to another place. On the
          consumerâ€™s request, the distributor at the current location will issue
          a Termination Voucher (TV) and will refund the deposit amount
          mentioned in the SV, on surrender of existing equipment (cylinders and
          regulator). The TV is valid for one year from the date of issue. It
          contains TV number, TV date, consumer number, SV number, SV date,
          cylinder type, consumer name, address, distributor, transferee
          distributor, amount paid, and remarks. Reconnection can be availed at
          the new place by payment of the same deposit amount mentioned in the
          TV. On receipt of the TV and deposit amount, the distributor sends a
          request to the area officer for transfer of consumer details. Then a
          new SV is issued to the consumer.
